    Heat a little oil and add:
          Diced brown onion
    Fry gently until onion is soft
    Then add:
          A teaspoon ground coriander
          A teapoon ground cumin  
          Small handfull of slivered almonds / pinenuts / chopped pistachios if you want
          Lime zest
    Fry gently for a couple of mins or until nice and toasted through
    Add:
          1 cup of rice and stir so it's coated
    Add:
          2 cups of chicken stock
    Bring to boil then cover, turn heat really low, set timer for 12 minutes
    After 12 minutes take off the heat completely and set timer for 12 minutes again

Bringing it together:
  The oven should be hot now
  Put fish on tray with the marinade salsa
  Bake for 12 minutes (i.e. same timer)
  Fish should be cooked through and crisp on edges
  Arrange fish on top of rice and add any tray juices
  Top with the remaining salsa and more lime juice
